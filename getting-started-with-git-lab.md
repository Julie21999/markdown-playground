# Getting started with Git Lab
## Instructions
In this lab, we'll be going through some basic tasks you'll need to do as you manage the GitHub repository for your CollectionBuilder site. The questions below are designed to help you learn and remember what you need to do to perform these tasks, as well as where you can go to look for help. 
## Creating your repository and editing files
**What did you click on to create a new repository in the web interface of Github (i.e., on Github.com)?**

I clicked the green "New" button, which opened a box that prompted the option to create a new repository. 

**What is the difference between a private and a public repository?**

A public repository is visible and readable to those outside your domain. A private repository is visible adn readable only to you or those you allow.

**Once your repository has been made and has at least one file, what button do you need to click on the web interface in order to create a new file in your repository?**

You can click the "Add File" button, which prompts either the "Create a new file" or "Upload files" as options. "Create a new file" will complete this task.

**Describe the steps you took to clone your repository on Github Desktop**

On Github Desktop, I went to the File under the menu bar, which has the option to clone repository. I clicked this option.

**What is the title of GitHub documentation?**

Github Docs

**What is the URL for GitHub documentation on creating your first repository?**

https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository

**Where is your local repository versus the remote repository?**

A local repository exists on your own computer directly. On the other hand, a remote repository is located on another server, like Github. 

**What happens when you fetch?** 

Fetching makes the local file in the local repository aware of and prepare for when changes are made in the remote repository. 

**What happens when you pull changes/commits?**

Pulling updates the local file in the local repository when changes are made in the remote repository.

**When working on GitHub Desktop, what order should you generally perform push, pull, and fetch?**

Fetch, pull, push

**What happens when you push commits from your local repository?**

This uploads the committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository.

**What is the URL for the Github glossary?**

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/github-glossary

**Where can you find a list of your commits?**

In the repository on github.com, there is a button within the repository that notes "Commits". Clicking this allows one to see all changes that have been made. In the Github Desktop, the "history" tab shows the list of commits, as well.

**What is the URL for documentation on reverting a commit?**

https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/reverting-a-commit-in-github-desktop

**How do you revert a commit?**
